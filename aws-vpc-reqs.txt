Requisitos de subnets para os clusters:

- The subnets must each have at least six IP addresses for use by Amazon EKS. However, we recommend at least 16 IP addresses.
- The subnets can’t reside in AWS Outposts, AWS Wavelength, or an AWS Local Zone. However, if you have them in your VPC, you can deploy self-managed nodes and Kubernetes resources to these types of subnets.
- The subnets can be a public or private. However, we recommend that you specify private subnets, if possible. A public subnet is a subnet with a route table that includes a route to an internet gateway, whereas a private subnet is a subnet with a route table that doesn’t include a route to an internet gateway.
- The subnets can’t reside in the following Availability Zones:
    * us-east-1 US East (N. Virginia) use1-az3
    * us-west-1 US West (N. California) usw1-az2
    * ca-central-1 Canada (Central) cac1-az3

Requisitos de subnets para os nodes:

- You can deploy nodes and Kubernetes resources to the same subnets that you specify when you create your cluster. However, this isn’t necessary. This is because you can also deploy nodes and Kubernetes resources to subnets that you didn’t specify when you created the cluster. If you deploy nodes to different subnets, Amazon EKS doesn’t create cluster network interfaces in those subnets. Any subnet that you deploy nodes and Kubernetes resources to must meet the following requirements:
- The subnets must have enough available IP addresses to deploy all of your nodes and Kubernetes resources to.
- If you need inbound access from the internet to your Pods, make sure to have at least one public subnet with enough available IP addresses to deploy load balancers and ingresses to. You can deploy load balancers to public subnets. Load balancers can load balance to Pods in private or public subnets. We recommend deploying your nodes to private subnets, if possible.
- If you plan to deploy nodes to a public subnet, the subnet must auto-assign IPv4 public addresses
- If the subnet that you deploy a node to is a private subnet and its route table doesn’t include a route to a network address translation (NAT) device (IPv4) or an egress-only gateway (IPv6), add VPC endpoints using AWS PrivateLink to your VPC. VPC endpoints are needed for all the AWS services that your nodes and Pods need to communicate with. Examples include Amazon ECR, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Security Token Service, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The endpoint must include the subnet that the nodes are in. Not all AWS services support VPC endpoints. For more information, see What is AWS PrivateLink? and AWS services that integrate with AWS PrivateLink. For a list of more Amazon EKS requirements, see Deploy private clusters with limited internet access.
- If you want to deploy load balancers to a subnet, the subnet must have the following tag:
    * Private subnets
        kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb = 1
    * Public subnets
        kubernetes.io/role/elb = 1
